   // 1. What is Short circuiting and What is it used for?
         Short circuit evaluation  works with the && and || logical operators. The expressions are evaluated left to right.
         So, if the condition is met and the rest of the conditions wonâ€™t affect the already evaluated result, the expression          will short-circuit and return that result.

   // 2. Demonstrate use of the Logical AND using the following comparison operators
   / // i. ===, >,>=,<,<=,!==

     AND with === and <
     const x = 10;
     const y = 15;
     console.log((x === 2) && (y < 10)); // false

     AND with > and <=
     
      const x = 10;
      const y = 15;
      console.log((x > 2) && (y <= 15)); // true

      AND with === and !==
      
     const x = 10;
     const y = 15;
     console.log((x === 10) && (y !== 15)); // false
